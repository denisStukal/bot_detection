## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Prerequisites

The code uses Python for extracting and preprocessing data from JSON files that store Twitter data. It uses R for actual data analysis. 

Please, make sure you download [twitter_bots](https://github.com/denisStukal/twitter_bots) module to extract all the necessary features from Twitter data.
